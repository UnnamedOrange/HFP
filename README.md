# HFP

Enable Hands-Free Profile on Android.

## Introduction

(Generated by AI): Hands-Free Profile (HFP) is a Bluetooth profile that allows wireless communication between a mobile phone and a hands-free device, such as a car kit or a headset. It enables functions like answering calls, ending calls, and adjusting volume without physically handling the phone. HFP relies on the Synchronous Connection-Oriented (SCO) link, which is a Bluetooth connection type designed for **real-time, low-latency audio transmission**, such as voice calls. SCO ensures clear and timely audio communication between devices. Together, HFP and SCO provide a seamless hands-free experience for users.

This project enables HFP on Android devices based on user preferences to deliver a low-latency experience for specific gaming scenarios.
